# simulate_xna_signal
simulate_xna_signal is a pip-installable python package to simulate the expected nanopore signal produced by a given genetic sequence including unnatural base pairs (XNA) from the Artificially Expanded Genetic Informatin System (AEGIS):  P, Z, B, S, J, V, K, and X, where S refers to the carbon-based S nucleotide ("Sc"). The user inputs the sequence of bases they would like to be simulated, and recieves as an output the simulated raw nanopore sequence plot for their input. The generated plot is a step function where each step corresponds to the average normalized current level generated by each base in the sequence that can be simulated. 

Experimental data used to generate this model was collected by the Marchand Lab at the University of Washington and is used in the following publication: 

Kawabe, H., Thomas, C.A., Hoshika, S. et al. Enzymatic synthesis and nanopore sequencing of 12-letter supernumerary DNA. Nat Commun 14, 6820 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42406-z

this package was created as a final project for bioen537 computational systems biology, taught by professors hellerstein and sauro at the university of washington in fall 2023
