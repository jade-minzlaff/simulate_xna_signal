# simulate_xna_signal
simulate_xna_signal is a pip-installable python package to simulate the expected nanopore signal produced by a given genetic sequence including unnatural base pairs (XNA) from the Artificially Expanded Genetic Informatin System (AEGIS):  P, Z, B, S, J, V, K, and X, where S refers to the carbon-based S nucleotide ("Sc"). The user inputs the sequence of bases they would like to be simulated, and recieves as an output the simulated raw nanopore sequence plot for their input. The generated plot is a step function where each step corresponds to the average normalized current level generated by each base in the sequence that can be simulated.
